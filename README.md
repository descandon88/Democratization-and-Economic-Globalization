# Democratization-and-Economic-Globalization
Presentation and analysis of Helen V. Milner and Bumba Mukherjee (2009) 
# Abstract
We address two questions that are central to the literature on the emergence of democracy and economic globalization. First, does democratization foster higher levels of trade and capital account openness? Second, do trade and capital account openness increase the likelihood of democratization? We review the literature in international political economy and comparative politics that has theoretically and empirically addressed these questions. We then conduct some empirical tests in a sample of developing countries to briefly evaluate the empirical relationship between democracy and economic globalization. Our analysis reveals that evidence for the claim that democracy fosters trade and capital account liberalization is robust but that empirical support for the predicted positive effect of economic openness on democracy among developing countries is weak. More theoretical work is needed to clarify the link between democracy and economic liberalization, and to this end we provide possible topics for future research.
# Introduction
1.The literature and our empirical analysis reveal that democracy positively influences trade and capital account openness but that neither trade nor financial openness influences the level of democracy.
2. a careful review of the relevant literature reveals that theoretical analyses of the potential causal impact of democracy on trade and especially capital account openness are underdeveloped.
3. Indeed, research on democracy and trade openness, we believe, will progress substantially only if scholars develop detailed causal theories that provide a comprehensive understanding of how the political dynamics of democracy in developing countries influences trade liberalization.
